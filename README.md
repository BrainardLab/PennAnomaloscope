# PennAnomaloscope

This site provides info on building the Penn Anomaloscope, an Arduino-based LED anomaloscope designed for teaching and (maybe) research.

The anomaloscope was developed by Leana Keesing and David Brainard, with support from Optica.  This site is a fork of Leana Keesing's original site, and is the one that is (as of 2025) being maintained.

## Materials

See parts list spreadsheet.

## Assembly Steps

1. Using the [instructions](/Electronics/README.md) in the Electronics folder, assemble the electronics necessary for the anomaloscope. This will require the correct parts (Arduino, shield, components) and soldering.
2. Using the [instructions](/CAD/README.md) and files in the CAD folder, 3D print the required components and assemble the entire anomaloscope.
3. Using the [sample code](/Code/) available in the Code folder and MATLAB, begin experimenting with the anomaloscope!
